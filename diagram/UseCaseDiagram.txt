UML-style textual diagram

Actors:
- [Visitor]
- [RegisteredUser]
- [Admin]

System boundary: (Blog Web App)

Use Cases and associations:
- [Visitor] -> (Browse Posts)
- [Visitor] -> (View Post Details)
- [Visitor] -> (Register)
- [Visitor] -> (Login/Logout)

- [RegisteredUser] -> (Browse Posts)
- [RegisteredUser] -> (View Post Details)
- [RegisteredUser] -> (Create Post)
- [RegisteredUser] -> (Edit Post)
- [RegisteredUser] -> (Delete Post)
- [RegisteredUser] -> (Upload Image)
- [RegisteredUser] -> (Manage Profile)

- [Admin] -> (Moderate Content)
- [Admin] -> (Admin Manage Users)
- [Admin] -> (Delete Post)  {can delete any post}

Include / Extend relationships:
- (Create Post) --extend--> (Upload Image)  [Upload Image extends Create Post when user inserts images]
- (Edit Post) --extend--> (Upload Image)
- (Register) --include--> (Email Service)  [send confirmation email]

Notes:
- (Upload Image) interacts with Storage (MEDIA) and provides a link back to the editor.
- (Serve Media) is a supporting system function used by Browse/View Post Details.

Optional PlantUML text (paste into PlantUML to render):

@startuml
left to right direction
actor Visitor
actor RegisteredUser as User
actor Admin
rectangle "Blog Web App" {
  Visitor -- (Browse Posts)
  Visitor -- (View Post Details)
  Visitor -- (Register)
  Visitor -- (Login/Logout)

  User -- (Browse Posts)
  User -- (View Post Details)
  User -- (Create Post)
  User -- (Edit Post)
  User -- (Delete Post)
  User -- (Upload Image)
  User -- (Manage Profile)

  Admin -- (Moderate Content)
  Admin -- (Admin Manage Users)
  Admin -- (Delete Post)

  (Create Post) .u.> (Upload Image) : <<extend>>
  (Edit Post) .u.> (Upload Image) : <<extend>>
  (Register) .u.> (Email Service) : <<include>>
}

If you want a PNG/SVG render, I can produce the PlantUML output and render it (requires PlantUML/JDK or external service). Otherwise this text follows UML use-case conventions and should be sufficient for documentation.
